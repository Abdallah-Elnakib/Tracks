# tells him whether it is an even or odd number.

# Write a Python program to check if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# Note: 
# An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
# A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
# An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.
# Expected Output:
# Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
# X: 6                                                                    
# Y: 8                                                                    
# Z: 12                                                                   
# Scalene triangle

# Write a Python program to find the median of three values.
# Expected Output:
# Input first number: 10                                                  
# Input second number: 5                                                
# Input third number: 7                                                 
# The median is 7

# Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.
# Expected Output:
# Input a number: 6                                                       
# 6 x 1 = 6                                                               
# 6 x 2 = 12                                                              
# 6 x 3 = 18                                                              
# 6 x 4 = 24                                                              
# 6 x 5 = 30                                                              
# 6 x 6 = 36                                                              
# 6 x 7 = 42
