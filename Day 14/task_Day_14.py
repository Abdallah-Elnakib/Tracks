# üìå Project Title:
# "Design and Implementation of a Library Management System Using Python, Tkinter GUI, and MySQL Database"

# üìù Project Overview
# This project involves building a desktop application using the Python programming language. 
# The application helps manage a library by allowing users to add, view, update, 
# delete, and search for books through a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter. 
# All the book data is stored and managed in a MySQL database, ensuring structured and secure data storage.

# üéØ Project Objectives
# To create a real-world Python application using object-oriented and modular programming principles.

# To design a clean graphical user interface using Tkinter.

# To connect Python applications with a MySQL database for data persistence.

# To understand and implement basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

# To practice handling form inputs, validations, and database queries.

# üß± Project Components
# 1. User Interface (Tkinter GUI)
# A simple and intuitive graphical interface allows the user (e.g., librarian or admin) to:

# Enter book details (title, author, year)

# View all books in the library

# Search for a specific book

# Edit or update existing book information

# Delete books from the database

# 2. Database (MySQL)
# A MySQL database is used to store and manage the book records. The database includes a books table with fields such as:

# ID (auto-incremented primary key)

# Book title

# Author name

# Year of publication

# 3. Backend Logic (Python)
# Python handles:

# Connecting to the MySQL database

# Executing database operations (CRUD)

# Managing user inputs and validations

# Controlling the application flow

# üñ•Ô∏è Core Functionalities
# Admin Login (Optional)
# A basic login screen for authorized access to the system (optional feature).

# Add Book
# Allows the user to input a book‚Äôs title, author, and year of publication and save it to the database.

# View Books
# Displays a list of all books stored in the database in a structured format.

# Edit Book
# Enables the user to update book information such as the title, author, or year.

# Delete Book
# Removes a selected book from the database.

# Search for a Book
# Allows searching for books by title or author for quick access.

# üóÉÔ∏è Database Design
# A database named library_db is created.

# It contains a table books to hold all book data.

# The table includes fields for ID, title, author, and year.
