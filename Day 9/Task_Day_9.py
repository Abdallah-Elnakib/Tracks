# You have a list of integers:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Your requirements:

# ✅ Using filter and lambda:

# Extract only even numbers from the list.

# ✅ Using map and lambda:

# Quadrupulate each even number (i.e., multiply it by itself).

# ✅ Using a recursive (self-defining) function:

# Calculate the sum of the results you obtained.

# ✍️ Expected format:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Step 1: filter => Extract even numbers
# Step 2: map => Square each even number
# Step 3: recursion => Add all results

# The final result should be the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 1 to 10

# You have a sentence containing multiple words:

# sentence = "Python is a powerful and beautiful programming language"
# Requirements:

# ✅ Using filter and lambda:

# Extract only words longer than 5 characters.

# ✅ Using map and lambda:

# Convert each word to uppercase.

# ✅ Using recursion:

# Print each word in the list one by one using a recursive function (without for or while).

# ✍️ Expected format:

# sentence = "Python is a powerful and beautiful programming language"

# # 1. Convert the sentence to a list of words
# # 2. filter => Select words with a length greater than 5
# # 3. map => Convert words to uppercase
# # 4. recursion => Print each word one by one
# 🎯 Expected result:
# After applying all steps to the sentence, words should appear like:

# PYTHON
# POWERFUL
# BEAUTIFUL
# PROGRAMMING
# LANGUAGE
