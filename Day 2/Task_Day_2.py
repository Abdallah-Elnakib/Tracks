# Write a Python program to combine two lists into a dictionary. 
# The elements of the first one serve as keys and the elements of the second one serve as values. 
# Each item in the first list must be unique and hashable.
# Sample Output:
# Original lists:
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Combine the values of the said two lists into a dictionary:
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}
# ======================================================================================================
# Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.
# color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
# ======================================================================================================
# Ask the user for their name, age, city of residence, and job title.
# After obtaining the data and storing it in a dictionary, ask the user to enter their hobbies from the given options. They will enter numbers for each hobby, for example:
# 1. Swimming, 2. Climbing, 3. Horseback riding, 4. Cycling.
# The user enters the numbers 1 or more, and they are added to their personal data. 
# Then, the text "Hello" is printed, along with the user's name, age, and user's age. 
# The user's job title is then entered. Then, "Do you have hobbies?" is entered.
