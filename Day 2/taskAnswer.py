# Ask the user for their name, age, city of residence, and job title.
# After obtaining the data and storing it in a dictionary, ask the user to enter 
# their hobbies from the given options. They will enter numbers for each hobby, 
# for example:
# 1. Swimming, 2. Climbing, 3. Horseback riding, 4. Cycling.
# The user enters the numbers 1 or more, and they are added to their personal data. 
# Then, the text "Hello" is printed, along with the user's name, age, and user's age. 
# The user's job title is then entered. Then, "Do you have hobbies?" is entered.

# data = {}
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# city = input("Enter your city of residence: ")
# job_title = input("Enter your job title: ")
# hobby = input("Enter your hobbies (1. Swimming, 2. Climbing, 3. Horseback riding, 4. Cycling.): ")

# data["name"] = name
# data["age"] = age
# data["city"] = city
# data["job_title"] = job_title
# data['hobbies'] = len(hobby)


# print("Hello", name, "! You are", age, "years old, from", city, "and you work as", job_title)

# Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.

# color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
# print("First color:", color_list[0], "\nLast color:", color_list[-1]  )

# Write a Python program to combine two lists into a dictionary. 
# The elements of the first one serve as keys and the elements of the second one serve as values. 
# Each item in the first list must be unique and hashable.
# Sample Output:
# Original lists:
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Combine the values of the said two lists into a dictionary:
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}

# x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
# y =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# z = {}
# print(len(x), len(y))
# z[x[0]] = y[0]
# z[x[1]] = y[1]
# z[x[2]] = y[2]
# z[x[3]] = y[3]
# z[x[4]] = y[4]
# print(z)
