# Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
# Given two integer numbers, write a Python program to return their product only 
# if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.
# =============================================================================================

# Exercise 2: Print the following pattern
# Write a Python code to print the following number pattern using a loop.

# 1 
# 1 2 
# 1 2 3 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 1 2 3 4 5

# Create a program that takes any sentence and encrypts it in three stages and gives you the encrypted sentence. 
# If you give it an encrypted sentence, it decrypts it and returns the correct word.


# =============================================================================================


# Exercise 3: Calculate sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
# Write a Python program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number

# For example, if the user entered 10, the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

# =============================================================================================

# Exercise 5: Display numbers from a list using a loop
# Write a Python program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

# The number must be divisible by five
# If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the following number
# If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop


# =============================================================================================

# Exercise 9: Find the largest item from list
# Given:

# x = [4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 2]

# =============================================================================================

# Exercise 17: Use a lambda with the sorted() function to sort a list of tuples based on the second element
# Given:

# data = [('apple', 5), ('banana', 2), ('cherry', 8), ('date', 1)]
# Expected Output:

# The sorted list of tuples based on the second element is: [('date', 1), ('banana', 2), ('apple', 5), ('cherry', 8)]


# =============================================================================================

# numbers = [20,6,18,19,7,5,2,16,15,10,4,3,14,1,13,17,8,9,11,12]
# Manually sort the list from smallest to largest.

# Exercise 19: Print Full Multiplication Table
# The multiplication table from 1 to 10 is a table that shows the products of numbers from 1 to 10.

# Write a code to generates a complete multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10.

# Given:

# multiplication table of: 1
#  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# multiplication table of: 2
#  2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
# multiplication table of: 3
#  3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
# ...
# multiplication table of: 10
#  10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100


# =============================================================================================


# Exercise 20: Print the alternate numbers pattern
# Pattern:

# 1  
# 2 3  
# 4 5 6  
# 7 8 9 10  
# 11 12 13 14 15
